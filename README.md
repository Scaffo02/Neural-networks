# Neural-networks

This repository contains my original implementation for the Neural Networks course project at the University of Turin (UniTo). The project involves creating and analyzing a neural network capable of classifying quantum systems as either entangled or separable. The methodology is inspired by the paper: Asif, N., Khalid, U., Khan, A. et al. Entanglement detection with artificial neural networks. Sci Rep 13, 1562 (2023),while the datasets were generated using the QETLAB library in MATLAB.
